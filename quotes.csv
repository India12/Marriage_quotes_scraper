My dear ... just for you: 

The secret to a happy marriage is finding the right person. You know they're right if you love to be with them all the time.
He that hath a wife and children hath given hostages to fortune; for they are impediments to great enterprises, either of virtue or mischief.
An anniversary is a reminder as to why you love and married this person.
No, the world must be peopled. When I said, I would die a bachelor, I did not think I should live till I were married.
We're all a little weird. And life is a little weird. And when we find someone whose weirdness is compatible with ours, we join up with them and fall into mutually satisfying weirdness - and call it love - true love.
