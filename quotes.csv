My dear ... just for you: 

There is no more lovely, friendly and charming relationship, communion or company than a good marriage.
It is not good that the man should be alone.
He that hath a wife and children hath given hostages to fortune; for they are impediments to great enterprises, either of virtue or mischief.
Goin' to the chapel and we're gonna get married
The secret to a happy marriage is finding the right person. You know they're right if you love to be with them all the time.
