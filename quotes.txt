My dear ... just for you: 

No, the world must be peopled. When I said, I would die a bachelor, I did not think I should live till I were married.
Marriage, in its truest sense, is a partnership of equals, with neither exercising dominion over the other, but, rather, with each encouraging and assisting the other in whatever responsibilities and aspirations he or she might have.
What therefore God hath joined together let not man put asunder.
Marriage is scary to me, man.
It's a beautiful night; We're looking for something dumb to do; Hey baby, I think I want to marry you
